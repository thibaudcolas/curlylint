## Hacking

Curlylint is powered by [Parsy](https://github.com/python-parsy/parsy). Parsy is an extremely powerful library and curlylintâ€™s parser relies heavily on it. You have to read
Parsyâ€™s documentation in order to understand whatâ€™s going on in
`parse.py`.

## Releases

- Update the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/curlylint/CHANGELOG.md).

- Make a PR and squash merge it.
- Back on the `main` branch with the PR merged, use `make publish-test` (confirm, and enter your password, confirm everything good on test.pypi.org).
- Back on the `main` branch with the PR merged, use `make publish` (confirm, and enter your password).
- Finally, go to GitHub and create a release and a tag for the new version.
