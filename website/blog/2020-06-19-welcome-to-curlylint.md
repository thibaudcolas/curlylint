Curlylint now has a website! ðŸŽ‰

<!-- truncate -->

While the linter itself is still very experimental, and subject to major changes, I believe that having great documentation is a much more important step than any single feature or linting rule of the linter. Particularly:

- Documenting the rules, with their respective configuration options, with lots of examples.
- Documenting CLI options, and (hopefully) future editor integrations.

With a standalone site (as opposed to Markdown files in GitHub), I can create clean URLs for each of the rules, that can then be used directly in the CLIâ€™s output. This is all inspired by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), which is years ahead of any other static analysis tool Iâ€™ve ever used.

## The website

The website itself is built with [Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/). I donâ€™t think this matters too much â€“ the main features I was after were:

- A focus on documentation websites â€“ with versioning, code highlighting.
- Being able to write docs in Markdown without having to worry about creating a theme, or manually writing HTML / CSS.
- Having a blog section and blogging features directly on the same docs website.

The fact that itâ€™s built with React is a plus that will come in handy should I want to build more bespoke pages. MDX is a plus too.

## Up next

Once the website is up and running, there are two things Iâ€™d really like to make:

- An editor integration with VS Code. Iâ€™ve had some exposure to this with [vscode-stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/vscode-stylelint), but still donâ€™t have the clearest understanding of how best to do this for a Python CLI.
- An online playground similar to that of [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). I think itâ€™s the best demonstrator of a toolâ€™s capabilities, and it simplifies bug reports / quick tests greatly.

Onwards!
